				<title>Winter Trip to Orr</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Grethe and I decided to have a little winter get-away at the cabin up north. This is a three-season cabin,
so it was a bit like winter camping. There was no running water, but there was a stove that kept the cabin
nice and toasty. There was even antique snowmobile races at Melgeorge&#39;s, the resort right down the road.
We had a great time!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2014 American Birkebeiner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Back again after another year. This year&#39;s Birkie was cold with lots of new snow from the day before
making the course difficult with race times slower than expected. I still had a blast, though and I
plan on doing it again next year. Maybe I&#39;ll be able to convince Grethe to ski with me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>St. John New Year</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to take a nice trip to the US Virgin Islands over New Year&#39;s.
We stayed on the island of St. John. The weather was great and we had a great
time snorkeling and relaxing on the beach. It was a 100+ degree temperature swing
when we got home! Hopefully some day we&#39;ll get to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Packrafting Eureka Creek</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the 4th of July, my wife, my father-in-law and I decided to take a packrafting trip in Alaska.
We did some research and found a cool trip that is described very well here:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://edplumb.blogspot.com/2008/09/mcclaren-summit-to-eureka-creek.html&quot;&gt;McClaren Summit to Eureka Creek Traverse&lt;/a&gt;
by Ed Plumb of Fairbanks, AK. It rained a little bit, but other than that, the trip was great.
I can&#39;t wait to do some more packrafting in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Oh, and we had to stop in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alaskamountaineering.com/&quot;&gt;Alaska Mountaineering &amp;amp; Hiking&lt;/a&gt; while we were in Anchorage!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>chruby: A Ruby Switcher I Can Live With</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never really been happy with &lt;a href=&quot;https://rvm.io/&quot;&gt;rvm&lt;/a&gt;. It always felt like it was trying to do too much. And, I
really didn&#39;t see the point of using gemsets when we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://gembundler.com/&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/a&gt;. I used
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/&quot;&gt;rbenv&lt;/a&gt; for a while, and it worked pretty well. But all I really wanted was a
simple way to switch between ruby binaries. Basically, this boils down to updating &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. Before I used
rbenv, I had been doing this manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/postmodern/chruby&quot;&gt;chruby&lt;/a&gt;. Chruby is a simple shell script does one thing, and does it well:
switch between ruby versions. It does this by updating &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. You can install your rubies anywhere you
want and chruby provides a command to switch between them by updating &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. By default it looks for
rubies in &lt;code&gt;/opt/rubies&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.rubies&lt;/code&gt;. It will find your system ruby, if installed, and allow
you to switch between that as well. It correctly sets &lt;code&gt;$GEM_HOME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$GEM_PATH&lt;/code&gt;, which can be
confusing if don&#39;t know what those environmental variable do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using chruby on most of my systems now, and I&#39;ll probably stick with it until the next greatest ruby switcher comes
along. Give it a try yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2013 American Birkebeiner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finished my first Birkie! The weather was great for skiing and the event was really well done.
I plan on coming back next year to get an even better time!
Thanks to all who donated to my JDRF fund raising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo above is from the lobby of the Telemark Lodge, which is the starting point for the race.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Set Game</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the game &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.setgame.com/set/index.html&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a challenging puzzle/card game where the players
attempt to find patterns amongst a group of cards. I also wanted to work on a project where I could use HTML5, so I
decided to implement the game of Set. The result can be found here:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://set-game.andrewtongen.net&quot;&gt;http://set-game.andrewtongen.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s built using sinatra with em-websocket, and redis on the back-end. The js client is built with backbonejs and
requirejs. Overall, it was a fun project and I learned a lot. You can check out the code for the project on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atongen/set_game&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Alaskan Xmas!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Grethe and I spent the holidays in Anchorage with her family.
It was a great trip; we went skiing a lot and I got to play with my new camera.
Thank you to the Denkewalters for putting us up and letting us hang around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alaskamountaineering.com/&quot;&gt;AMH&lt;/a&gt; the whole time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>I Reached My Goal</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I reached my goal of collecting $500 in donations for the JDRF! A huge thanks to everyone who donated. See you at the Berkie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t still collect donations, though. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
